# Loading Components

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Purpose**: Structural documentation for Loading component family (placeholder)
**Organization**: process-standard
**Scope**: cross-project
**Layer**: 3
**Relevant Tasks**: component-development, architecture-planning
**Last Reviewed**: 2026-07-08

## Family Overview

**Family**: Loading
**Shared Need**: Progress indication
**Readiness**: 🔴 Placeholder

> ⚠️ **Placeholder Status**: This family is structurally defined but not yet implemented. 
> Do not use these components in production. This documentation describes planned architecture.

### Purpose

The Loading family will provide components for indicating progress and loading states. Components will support indeterminate spinners, determinate progress bars, and skeleton placeholders.

### Planned Characteristics

- **Indeterminate Loading**: Spinners for unknown duration operations
- **Determinate Progress**: Progress bars with percentage indication
- **Skeleton Placeholders**: Content placeholders during data loading
- **Size Variants**: Multiple sizes for different contexts
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects prefers-reduced-motion preference

### Stemma System Integration

- **Primitive Base**: Loading-Base (planned)
- **Semantic Variants**: 3 planned (Spinner, Progress, Skeleton)
- **Cross-Platform**: web, ios, android (planned)

## Behavioral Contracts

### Planned Base Contracts

| Contract | Description | WCAG | Platforms |
|----------|-------------|------|-----------|
| `animated_indicator` | Shows animated loading indicator | 2.3.3 | web, ios, android |
| `reduced_motion_support` | Respects prefers-reduced-motion | 2.3.3 | web, ios, android |
| `accessible_status` | Announces loading state to screen readers | 4.1.3 | web, ios, android |
| `size_variants` | Supports multiple size variants | N/A | web, ios, android |
| `color_variants` | Supports semantic color variants | 1.4.1 | web, ios, android |

## Token Dependencies

### Planned Token Requirements

| Category | Token Pattern | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Color | `color.loading.primary` | Primary loading color |
| Color | `color.loading.track` | Progress track color |
| Motion | `motion.loading.spin` | Spinner animation timing |
| Motion | `motion.loading.pulse` | Skeleton pulse animation |
| Spacing | `loading.size.*` | Loading indicator sizes |

> **Note**: Token patterns are planned and may change during implementation.

## Usage Guidelines

> ⚠️ **Not Available**: Usage guidelines will be documented when components are implemented.

### Planned Use Cases

- Page loading indicators
- Button loading states
- Data fetching placeholders
- File upload progress
- Skeleton screens during initial load

---

## Cross-Platform Notes

> ⚠️ **Not Available**: Platform-specific notes will be documented when components are implemented.

### Planned Platform Support

- Web: Web Components with CSS animations
- iOS: SwiftUI ProgressView
- Android: Jetpack Compose CircularProgressIndicator
