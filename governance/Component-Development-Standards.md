## Family Creation Decision Framework

### When to Create a New Family

**Create a new family when ALL of these criteria are met**:

| Criterion | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Shared Purpose** | Do components share a common purpose that doesn't fit existing families? | "Progress indication" doesn't fit Form Inputs or Buttons |
| **Multiple Variants** | Can you identify at least 3 potential semantic variants? | Loading: Spinner, Progress, Skeleton |
| **Clear Base Behaviors** | Can you define foundational behaviors that ALL variants share? | All loading indicators: `state_loading`, `accessibility_aria_label` |
| **Cross-Platform Need** | Is this needed across web, iOS, and Android? | Yes - all platforms need loading indicators |

**Do NOT create a new family when**:
- The component fits within an existing family's purpose
- Only 1-2 variants are needed (consider adding to existing family)
- Behaviors don't generalize across variants
- It's platform-specific functionality

### Family vs Component Decision Tree

```
Need a new component?
    │
    ├── Does it fit an existing family's purpose?
    │   ├── YES → Add as semantic variant to existing family
    │   └── NO → Continue evaluation...
    │
    ├── Can you identify 3+ semantic variants?
    │   ├── YES → Continue evaluation...
    │   └── NO → Consider standalone component or existing family
    │
    ├── Do variants share foundational behaviors?
    │   ├── YES → Create new family
    │   └── NO → May need multiple families or standalone components
    │
    └── Human-AI checkpoint for approval
```

## Step-by-Step Family Creation Process

### Phase 1: Planning and Design

#### Step 1.1: Define Family Purpose

Document the shared need that unites all components in the family.

**Template**:
```markdown
## Family: [Family Name]

**Shared Need**: [One sentence describing what all components in this family do]

**Examples of Use Cases**:
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]
- [Use case 3]

**Why This Needs a New Family**:
[Explain why existing families don't cover this need]
```

**Form Inputs Example**:
```markdown
## Family: Form Inputs

**Shared Need**: Data collection and validation

**Examples of Use Cases**:
- Collecting email addresses with validation
- Secure password entry with visibility toggle
- Phone number collection with formatting

**Why This Needs a New Family**:
Form inputs share common behaviors (focusable, validatable, float-label) that don't 
fit within Buttons (action-focused) or Containers (layout-focused).
```

#### Step 1.2: Identify Primitive Base Behaviors

List the foundational behaviors that ALL semantic variants will inherit.

**Behavior Identification Checklist**:
- [ ] What interaction patterns are common to all variants?
- [ ] What accessibility requirements apply to all variants?
- [ ] What visual states are shared (focus, error, disabled)?
- [ ] What token dependencies are universal?

**Template**:
```yaml
base_behaviors:
  - behavior_name: [name]
    description: [what it does]
    wcag_reference: [WCAG criterion if applicable]
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
```

**Form Inputs Example**:
```yaml
base_behaviors:
  - behavior_name: focusable
    description: Can receive keyboard focus via Tab key
    wcag_reference: WCAG 2.1.1
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    
  - behavior_name: float_label_animation
    description: Label animates between placeholder and floated positions
    wcag_reference: WCAG 2.3.3
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    
  - behavior_name: validates_on_blur
    description: Validation triggers when field loses focus
    wcag_reference: WCAG 3.3.1
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    
  - behavior_name: error_state_display
    description: Shows error message and visual error indication
    wcag_reference: WCAG 3.3.1, 1.4.1
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
```

#### Step 1.3: Plan Semantic Variants

Identify the semantic variants that will extend the primitive base.

**Variant Planning Template**:
```markdown
### Semantic Variant: [Variant Name]

**Inherits From**: [Primitive Base]
**Specialized Purpose**: [What makes this variant unique]

**Extended Behaviors**:
- [Behavior 1]: [Description]
- [Behavior 2]: [Description]

**Extended Properties**:
- [Property 1]: [Type] - [Description]
- [Property 2]: [Type] - [Description]
```

**Form Inputs Example**:
```markdown
### Semantic Variant: Input-Text-Email

**Inherits From**: Input-Text-Base
**Specialized Purpose**: Email address collection with validation and autocomplete

**Extended Behaviors**:
- validates_email_format: Validates input against RFC 5322 email pattern
- provides_email_autocomplete: Enables browser/platform email autofill

**Extended Properties**:
- customValidator: (email: string) => boolean - Custom validation function
- invalidEmailMessage: string - Custom error message for invalid emails
```

#### Step 1.4: Human-AI Checkpoint

**Before proceeding to implementation, present the following for Human approval**:

1. Family purpose and justification
2. Primitive base behaviors (complete list)
3. Planned semantic variants (at least 3)
4. Naming convention decisions
5. Token dependency overview

**Checkpoint Questions**:
- Does this family fill a genuine gap in the component system?
- Are the base behaviors truly universal to all variants?
- Is the naming convention clear and consistent?
- Are there any existing components that should be migrated to this family?

---

### Phase 2: Naming Convention Decisions

#### Step 2.1: Choose Naming Pattern

Select the appropriate naming pattern based on family characteristics.

**Decision Framework**:

| Family Characteristic | Pattern | Example |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| Foundational component, no specific type needed | `[Family]-Base` | `Container-Base`, `Icon-Base` |
| Has semantic variants with shared type | `[Family]-[Type]-Base` | `Input-Text-Base` |
| Standalone with descriptive type | `[Family]-[Type]` | `Button-CTA` |

**Form Inputs Decision**:
- Family has multiple types (Text, Select, Checkbox, etc.)
- Text inputs have semantic variants (Email, Password, PhoneNumber)
- Pattern: `[Family]-[Type]-Base` → `Input-Text-Base`
- Semantic variants: `Input-Text-Email`, `Input-Text-Password`

#### Step 2.2: Document Naming Rationale

```markdown
### Naming Convention for [Family Name]

**Pattern Used**: [Pattern]
**Rationale**: [Why this pattern was chosen]

**Primitive Component**: [Name]
**Semantic Variants**:
- [Variant 1 Name]
- [Variant 2 Name]
- [Variant 3 Name]
```

---

### Phase 3: Schema Definition

#### Step 3.1: Create Primitive Base Schema

Create the YAML schema for the primitive base component.

**Schema Location**: `src/components/core/[Component-Name]/[Component-Name].schema.yaml`

**Required Schema Sections**:
```yaml
# Identity
name: [Component-Name]
type: primitive
family: [FamilyName]

# Behaviors
behaviors:
  - [behavior1]
  - [behavior2]

# Properties
properties:
  [property_name]:
    type: [string | boolean | number | enum]
    required: [true | false]
    default: [default_value]
    description: [description]

# Contracts
contracts:
  - name: [contract_name]
    description: [what the contract guarantees]
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    required: [true | false]
    wcag: [WCAG reference if applicable]

# Token Dependencies
tokens:
  - [token.pattern.*]

# Platform Support
platforms: [web, ios, android]

# Status
readiness: [placeholder | beta | production-ready]
```

**Form Inputs Example** (Input-Text-Base):
```yaml
name: Input-Text-Base
type: primitive
family: FormInput

behaviors:
  - focusable
  - validatable
  - float-label

properties:
  id:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Unique identifier for the input element
  label:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Label text (floats between placeholder and floated positions)
  value:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Current input value
  onChange:
    type: function
    required: true
    description: Callback when value changes
  errorMessage:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: Error message to display
  disabled:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
    description: Whether input is disabled

contracts:
  - name: interaction_focusable
    description: Can receive keyboard focus via Tab key navigation
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    required: true
    wcag: "2.1.1"
  - name: content_float_label
    description: Label animates from placeholder to floating position on focus
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    required: true
    wcag: "2.3.3"
  - name: validation_on_blur
    description: Validation triggers when field loses focus
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    required: true
    wcag: "3.3.1"
  - name: state_error
    description: Displays error message and visual error indication
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    required: true
    wcag: "3.3.1, 1.4.1"

tokens:
  - typography.labelMd
  - typography.input
  - color.text.*
  - color.primary
  - color.error
  - space.inset.*
  - motion.floatLabel
  - accessibility.focus.*

platforms: [web, ios, android]
readiness: production-ready
```

#### Step 3.2: Create Semantic Variant Schemas

For each semantic variant, create a schema that extends the base.

**Semantic Schema Template**:
```yaml
name: [Variant-Name]
type: semantic
family: [FamilyName]
inherits: [Base-Component-Name]

# Additional behaviors (extends base)
behaviors:
  # Inherits all base behaviors
  - [extended_behavior1]
  - [extended_behavior2]

# Extended properties (in addition to inherited)
extends:
  properties:
    [new_property]:
      type: [type]
      required: [true | false]
      description: [description]

# Extended contracts (in addition to inherited)
contracts:
  # Inherits all base contracts
  - name: [extended_contract]
    description: [description]
    platforms: [web, ios, android]
    required: [true | false]

platforms: [web, ios, android]
readiness: [status]
```

---

### Phase 4: Implementation

#### Step 4.1: Create Directory Structure

```
src/components/core/[Component-Name]/
├── [Component-Name].schema.yaml
├── index.ts
├── types.ts
├── tokens.ts
├── README.md
├── __tests__/
│   └── [Component-Name].test.ts
└── platforms/
    ├── web/
    │   ├── [Component-Name].web.ts
    │   └── styles.css
    ├── ios/
    │   └── [Component-Name].ios.swift
    └── android/
        └── [Component-Name].android.kt
```

#### Step 4.2: Implement Primitive Base

**Implementation Order**:
1. Define types (`types.ts`)
2. Define token mappings (`tokens.ts`)
3. Implement web component (`platforms/web/`)
4. Implement iOS component (`platforms/ios/`)
5. Implement Android component (`platforms/android/`)
6. Write tests (`__tests__/`)
7. Create README documentation

**Key Implementation Principles**:
- All behavioral contracts MUST be implemented on all platforms
- Token usage MUST follow Rosetta System patterns
- Accessibility requirements MUST be met per WCAG references
- Platform-specific implementations are allowed if contracts are preserved

#### Step 4.3: Implement Semantic Variants

For each semantic variant:
1. Extend the primitive base
2. Add extended behaviors
3. Add extended properties
4. Implement extended contracts
5. Write variant-specific tests

**Inheritance Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] All base contracts are preserved
- [ ] All base properties are available
- [ ] Extended behaviors don't conflict with base
- [ ] Token dependencies include base tokens

**Location**: `.kiro/steering/Component-Family-[FamilyName].md`

**Required Sections**:
1. Family Overview
2. Inheritance Structure
3. Behavioral Contracts
4. Component Schemas
5. Token Dependencies
6. Usage Guidelines
7. Cross-Platform Notes
8. Related Documentation

**Use the MCP Component Family Document Template**: `.kiro/steering/Component-MCP-Document-Template.md`

#### Step 5.2: Update Component Quick Reference

Add the new family to the Component Quick Reference routing table.

**Location**: `.kiro/steering/Component-Quick-Reference.md`

**Add entry**:
```markdown
| [Family Name] | [Shared Need] | `.kiro/steering/Component-Family-[FamilyName].md` | [Status] |
```

#### Step 5.3: Update Inheritance Structures Document

Add the new family to the Component Family Inheritance Structures document.

**Location**: `.kiro/steering/Component-Inheritance-Structures.md`

**Add section with**:
- Inheritance structure diagram
- Component summary table
- Behavioral contracts
- Token dependencies
- MCP documentation reference

## Primitive vs Semantic Decision Criteria

### When to Create a Primitive Component

**Create a primitive (Base) component when**:

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Foundational Behaviors** | The component provides behaviors that multiple semantic variants will share |
| **No Specialized Purpose** | The component doesn't have a specific use case beyond being a foundation |
| **Extensibility Required** | Semantic variants will extend this with specialized functionality |
| **Coverage Gap Legitimate** | Using the primitive directly is acceptable when no semantic variant fits |

### When to Create a Semantic Component

**Create a semantic component when**:

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Specialized Purpose** | The component has a specific, well-defined use case |
| **Extended Behaviors** | The component adds behaviors beyond the primitive base |
| **Domain-Specific** | The component handles domain-specific validation, formatting, or functionality |
| **Reusable Pattern** | The specialized behavior is needed in multiple places |

### Decision Examples

| Scenario | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Need a text input for any text | Use `Input-Text-Base` | No specialized validation needed |
| Need email input with validation | Use `Input-Text-Email` | Semantic variant exists with email validation |
| Need credit card input | Create `Input-Text-CreditCard` | Specialized formatting and validation needed |
| Need a generic container | Use `Container-Base` | No specialized layout behavior needed |
| Need a card with shadow | Create `Container-Card` | Specialized elevation and styling |

### Primitive Usage Philosophy

**Key Distinction from Token Philosophy**:

| System | Primitive Usage | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Tokens** | Discouraged | Semantic tokens provide context and maintainability |
| **Components** | Legitimate | Primitives serve as valid coverage gap solutions |

**When Primitive Component Usage is Appropriate**:
1. No semantic variant exists for the use case
2. Building custom functionality that doesn't fit existing variants
3. Prototyping new patterns before creating semantic variants
4. One-off use cases that don't warrant a new semantic variant

**Goal**: Reduce primitive usage over time by creating semantic variants for common patterns, NOT by avoiding primitives entirely.

## Form Inputs Family: Implementation Reference

The Form Inputs family serves as the reference implementation for family creation. Key lessons learned:

### What Worked Well

1. **Clear Base Behaviors**: Defining 9 foundational contracts that ALL variants inherit
2. **Consistent Naming**: `Input-Text-Base` → `Input-Text-Email` pattern is predictable
3. **Token Dependency Documentation**: Comprehensive token mapping enables consistent styling
4. **Cross-Platform Contracts**: Same contracts implemented identically across platforms

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start with Contracts**: Define behavioral contracts before implementation
2. **Document Token Dependencies Early**: Token mapping should be part of schema design
3. **Test Inheritance**: Verify semantic variants properly inherit base behaviors
4. **Accessibility First**: WCAG references in contracts ensure compliance

### Reference Files

| Artifact | Location |

### Review Stages

#### Stage 1: Planning Review (Human-AI Checkpoint)

**Timing**: After Phase 1 (Planning and Design) completion

**Reviewer**: Human partner

**Review Criteria**:
| Criterion | Pass Condition |
|-----------|----------------|
| Family Justification | Clear explanation of why existing families don't cover the need |
| Base Behaviors | Minimum 5 foundational behaviors identified |
| Semantic Variants | Minimum 3 planned variants with clear purposes |
| Naming Convention | Pattern selected with documented rationale |

**Documentation**: Record approval in completion document with date and reviewer notes

#### Stage 2: Schema Review

**Timing**: After Phase 3 (Schema Definition) completion

**Reviewer**: AI agent (automated validation) + Human partner (semantic review)

**Automated Validation Checks**:
```yaml
schema_validation:
  # Per spec 063, contracts live in contracts.yaml — NOT in the schema. These
  # five fields are what schema validation actually requires (see
  # src/__tests__/stemma-system/behavioral-contract-validation.test.ts).
  required_fields:
    - name
    - type
    - family
    - behaviors
    - platforms

  # Authored by convention, but NOT presence-checked by schema validation:
  #   properties, tokens, readiness (and `inherits` on semantic variants)
  # Contract-level checks below read the component's contracts.yaml, not the
  # schema; contracts.yaml must exist and declare at least one contract.
  
  type_validation:
    - type must be: primitive | semantic | standalone
    - readiness must be: placeholder | beta | production-ready
    - platforms must include: web, ios, android

## Integration Requirements

This section documents the requirements for integrating new component families with the existing Stemma System infrastructure.

### MCP Server Integration

#### Document Registration

New family MCP documents must be registered with the designerpunk-docs MCP server:

1. **Create Document**: Place family document at `.kiro/steering/Component-Family-[FamilyName].md`
2. **Add Front-Matter**: Include `inclusion: manual` in YAML front-matter
3. **Verify Indexing**: Run `mcp_designerpunk_docs_get_index_health()` to verify document is indexed
4. **Rebuild if Needed**: Run `mcp_designerpunk_docs_rebuild_index()` if document not appearing

#### Progressive Disclosure Support

Family documents must support the MCP progressive disclosure workflow:

```yaml
progressive_disclosure_requirements:
  summary_query:
    - Document summary returns metadata and section outline
    - Summary is under 500 tokens
    - Key information visible without full document load
  
  section_query:
    - Each major section is independently queryable
    - Section headings are unique and descriptive
    - Sections are self-contained where possible
  
  full_document_query:
    - Full document returns complete content
    - Document is well-organized for scanning
    - Cross-references use relative paths
```

### Component Quick Reference Integration

#### Routing Table Entry

Add new family to the Component Quick Reference routing table:

```markdown
| [Family Name] | [Shared Need/Purpose] | `.kiro/steering/Component-Family-[FamilyName].md` | [Status] |
```

**Entry Requirements**:
- Family name matches naming convention
- Shared need is concise (under 50 characters)
- MCP path is accurate and tested
- Status reflects current readiness (🟢 Production Ready, 🟡 Beta, 🔴 Placeholder)

### Inheritance Structures Integration

#### Family Section

Add new family section to `Component-Inheritance-Structures.md`:

```markdown
## [Family Name] Family

**Shared Need**: [Purpose statement]
**MCP Documentation**: `.kiro/steering/Component-Family-[FamilyName].md`

### Inheritance Structure

[ASCII or Mermaid diagram]

### Component Summary

| Component | Type | Inherits | Status | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| [Component] | [Type] | [Base] | [Status] | [Description] |

### Behavioral Contracts

[List of key contracts]

### Token Dependencies

[List of key token patterns]
```

### Browser Entry Integration (Web Components)

#### Component Registration

Register web components in `src/browser-entry.ts`:

```typescript
// Import component
import { [ComponentName] } from './components/core/[Component-Name]/platforms/web/[ComponentName].web';

// Register custom element
if (!customElements.get('[component-name]')) {
  customElements.define('[component-name]', [ComponentName]);
}

// For backward compatibility (if renaming existing component)
if (!customElements.get('[old-component-name]')) {
  customElements.define('[old-component-name]', [ComponentName]);
}
```

**Registration Requirements**:
- Custom element name follows kebab-case convention
- Check for existing registration before defining
- Include backward compatibility registration if renaming

### Validation Infrastructure Integration

#### Stemma Validators

New families should be validated by existing Stemma validators:

```yaml
validator_integration:
  naming_validator:
    - Component names validated against [Family]-[Type]-[Variant] pattern
    - Validator: StemmaComponentNamingValidator
  
  token_validator:
    - Token usage validated against schema dependencies
    - Validator: StemmaTokenUsageValidator
  
  accessibility_validator:
    - Accessibility properties validated
    - Validator: StemmaPropertyAccessibilityValidator
```

#### Test Infrastructure

New families should integrate with existing test infrastructure:

```yaml
test_integration:
  contract_tests:
    - Location: src/__tests__/stemma-system/
    - Pattern: [family-name]-contracts.test.ts
    - Reporter: contract-test-reporter.ts
  
  cross_platform_tests:
    - Location: src/__tests__/stemma-system/
    - Pattern: cross-platform-consistency.test.ts
    - Add family to test matrix
```

### Release Detection Integration

#### Completion Documentation

1. **Create Summary Document**: `docs/specs/[spec-name]/task-N-summary.md`
2. **Open the Task PR**: `./.kiro/hooks/complete-task.sh "Task N Complete: Description (<spec>)"` — complete at merge; release analysis runs post-merge on `main`

#### Version Impact

New families typically warrant:
- **Minor Version Bump**: New family with Production Ready components
- **Patch Version Bump**: New family with Beta or Placeholder components only
