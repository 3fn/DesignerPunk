# Release Management System - Examples

**Date**: November 28, 2025  
**Last Reviewed**: 2025-12-30  
**Purpose**: Example configurations and tutorials for different project types  
**Organization**: process-standard  
**Scope**: cross-project

> ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED — pending review (2026-06-27).** These examples document the pre-rebuild release CLI (`release:cli plan` / `release auto`), replaced when the release system was rebuilt (Spec 065 — release-system-rebuild). The current internal tool is `analyze` / `notes` / `release` (`npm run release:analyze | notes | run`); there is **no consumer-facing release command yet**. **Do not follow these steps.** The whole release-management doc corpus is slated for review/rewrite — see [`roadmap/release-system-review.md`](../roadmap/release-system-review.md).

## Overview

This directory contains example configurations, step-by-step tutorials, and integration examples for the Release Management System. Examples cover different project types, release strategies, and common scenarios.

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Project Type

**Single Package:**
- One package.json
- Simple versioning
- Start with: [Single Package Configuration](./configurations/single-package.json)

**Monorepo (Synchronized):**
- Multiple packages
- All packages share same version
- Start with: [Monorepo Synchronized Configuration](./configurations/monorepo-synchronized.json)

**Monorepo (Independent):**
- Multiple packages
- Each package has independent version
- Start with: [Monorepo Independent Configuration](./configurations/monorepo-independent.json)

### 2. Follow the Tutorial

**First Time User:**
1. Read [First Release Tutorial](./tutorials/01-first-release.md)
2. Set up configuration
3. Execute first release
4. Verify on GitHub

**Experienced User:**
- Jump to specific scenario tutorial
- Adapt configuration examples
- Integrate with CI/CD

### 3. Integrate with Your Workflow

**Manual Releases:**
- Use CLI commands
- Review release plans
- Execute with confirmation

**Automated Releases:**
- Set up CI/CD integration
- Configure automatic triggers
- Monitor release pipeline

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bug Fix Release

**Goal:** Release a patch version with bug fixes

**Steps:**
1. Complete bug fix work
2. Create completion document
3. Run: `npm run release:cli plan`
4. Verify patch bump (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
5. Run: `npm run release:cli release auto`

**Tutorial:** [Patch Release](./tutorials/02-patch-release.md)

### Scenario 2: New Feature Release

**Goal:** Release a minor version with new features

**Steps:**
1. Complete feature implementation
2. Create spec completion document
3. Run: `npm run release:cli plan`
4. Verify minor bump (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
5. Run: `npm run release:cli release auto`

**Tutorial:** [Minor Release](./tutorials/03-minor-release.md)

### Scenario 3: Breaking Change Release

**Goal:** Release a major version with breaking changes

**Steps:**
1. Complete breaking change implementation
2. Document breaking changes and migration
3. Run: `npm run release:cli plan`
4. Verify major bump (0.1.0 → 1.0.0)
5. Review breaking changes carefully
6. Run: `npm run release:cli release auto`

**Tutorial:** [Major Release](./tutorials/04-major-release.md)

### Scenario 4: Multi-Package Coordination

**Goal:** Release multiple packages with coordinated versions

**Steps:**
1. Complete work affecting multiple packages
2. System automatically coordinates versions
3. Run: `npm run release:cli plan`
4. Verify all packages updated
5. Run: `npm run release:cli release auto`

**Tutorial:** [Multi-Package](./tutorials/05-multi-package.md)

### Scenario 5: CI/CD Automation

**Goal:** Automate releases in CI/CD pipeline

**Steps:**
1. Set up CI/CD configuration
2. Configure secrets (tokens)
3. Add release workflow
4. Test with dry run
5. Enable automatic releases

**Tutorial:** [CI/CD Integration](./tutorials/06-ci-cd-integration.md)

## Best Practices

### Configuration

- ✅ Use environment variables for tokens
- ✅ Validate configuration before first release
- ✅ Test with dry run before actual release
- ✅ Keep configuration in version control (without tokens)

### Documentation

- ✅ Write clear completion documents
- ✅ Document breaking changes with migration guidance
- ✅ Include before/after examples
- ✅ Reference requirements in completion docs

### Testing

- ✅ Preview release plan before executing
- ✅ Use dry run for testing
- ✅ Verify on GitHub after release
- ✅ Test rollback procedures

### Automation

- ✅ Start with manual releases
- ✅ Test automation with dry run
- ✅ Monitor automated releases
- ✅ Have manual override available
