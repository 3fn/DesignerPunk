# Start Up Tasks

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Last Reviewed**: 2026-01-03
**Purpose**: Essential checklist for every task (date check, Jest commands, test selection, completion sequence)
**Organization**: process-standard
**Scope**: cross-project
**Layer**: 1
**Relevant Tasks**: all-tasks

1. Check the **CURRENT** date

2. **Civitas Governance Health Check**
   
   IF it's been >30 days since last governance health check **[2026-05-03]**, THEN flag: "Governance health check overdue — switch to Thurgood (`ctrl+shift+t`) to run monthly health check before proceeding."
   
   *Only Thurgood runs the health check. All agents check the date and flag if overdue.*

3. **CRITICAL: Wait for User Authorization Before Starting New Tasks**
   
   **WHEN reporting the completion of a task THEN you MUST:**
   - **STOP and WAIT for user authorization before starting the next task**
   - Do NOT automatically proceed to the next task in the task list
   - Do NOT assume the user wants you to continue
   
   **User Authorization Required:**
   - User must explicitly request the next task
   - User may want to review your work first
   - User may want to provide additional context
   - User may want to change direction
   
   **Example Completion Pattern:**
   ```
   ✅ Task 2.2 Complete: Implemented Icon iOS confirmed actions
   
   Summary:
   - Added token-only sizing approach
   - Added testID support via accessibilityIdentifier
   - Updated preview to use token references
   
   [STOP HERE - WAIT FOR USER TO REQUEST NEXT TASK]
   ```
   
   **NEVER do this:**
   - ❌ "Task 2.2 complete. Now starting Task 2.3..."
   - ❌ Automatically reading files for the next task
   - ❌ Beginning implementation without explicit user request

4. **CRITICAL: This project uses Jest, NOT Vitest**
   
   **WHEN running tests THEN you MUST use Jest commands (NOT Vitest commands)**
   
   ✅ **CORRECT Jest commands:**
   - `npm test` - Run unit/integration tests (fast, ~10 min)
   - `npm run test:all` - Run ALL tests including performance (~28 min)
   - `npm run test:performance` - Run only performance tests (~20 min)
   - `npm test -- <test-file-path>` - Run specific test file
   - `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
   - `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
   
   ❌ **WRONG - These are Vitest commands that will FAIL:**
   - `npm test -- --run` - Jest doesn't have a `--run` flag
   - `vitest` - This project doesn't use Vitest
   
   **Key difference:** Jest runs tests once by default. Vitest uses `--run` for single execution, but Jest doesn't need or support this flag.

5. **Test Command Selection Guidelines**
   
   **WHEN validating regular task completion THEN:**
   - Use `npm test` (default - excludes performance tests)
   - Fast feedback loop (~10 minutes)
   - Sufficient for most development validation
   
   **WHEN validating parent task completion THEN:**
   - **Default**: Use `npm test` (comprehensive functional validation, ~10 min)
   - **If task modifies release tool**: Use `npm run test:all` (~28 min)
   - **If task is performance-critical**: Use `npm run test:all` (~28 min)
   
   **WHEN task involves performance changes THEN:**
   - Use `npm run test:performance` (performance validation only)
   - Validates performance characteristics (~20 minutes)
   - Use for performance optimization tasks
   
   **Decision tree:**
   ```
   Is this a parent task completion?
   ├─ YES → Does task modify release tool or performance systems?
   │   ├─ YES → npm run test:all (includes performance regression tests)
   │   └─ NO → npm test (comprehensive functional validation)
   └─ NO → Does task involve performance changes?
       ├─ YES → npm run test:performance
       └─ NO → npm test (default)
   ```
   
   **Key distinction:**
   - `npm test` validates all functionality including release analysis (functional tests only)
   - `npm run test:all` adds 20 minutes of performance regression tests for release analysis
   - Most parent tasks only need functional validation
   
   **Default assumption**: Use `npm test` for parent tasks unless working on release tool or performance systems.

6. **CRITICAL: Task Completion Sequence (MUST FOLLOW)**
   
   **DO NOT mark tasks complete before completing the required steps for that task type.**
   
   **📖 Query Completion Documentation Guide via MCP for detailed guidance:**
   ```
   get_section({ path: ".kiro/steering/Completion Documentation Guide.md", heading: "Two-Document Workflow" })
   get_section({ path: ".kiro/steering/Completion Documentation Guide.md", heading: "Documentation Tiers" })
   ```

   **For SUBTASKS:**
   1. [ ] Run targeted tests relevant to the change (not full suite)
   2. [ ] Create completion doc: `.kiro/specs/[spec]/completion/task-N-M-completion.md`
   3. [ ] Mark subtask complete (use `taskStatus` tool)
   4. [ ] **STOP** and wait for user authorization
   
   ---
   
   **For PARENT TASKS (Implementation or Architecture type):**
   1. [ ] Run full validation (`npm test`) - see #4 for test command selection
   2. [ ] Mark parent task complete (use `taskStatus` tool) **AFTER** validation passes
   3. [ ] Create completion doc: `.kiro/specs/[spec]/completion/task-N-completion.md`
   4. [ ] Create summary doc: `docs/specs/[spec]/task-N-summary.md`
   5. [ ] Commit changes: `./.kiro/hooks/commit-task.sh "Task N Complete: Description"` (runs release analysis automatically)
   6. [ ] **STOP** and wait for user authorization
   
   ---
   
   **For PARENT TASKS (Setup or Documentation type):**
   1. [ ] Verify artifacts created/updated as specified
   2. [ ] Mark parent task complete (use `taskStatus` tool)
   3. [ ] Create completion doc: `.kiro/specs/[spec]/completion/task-N-completion.md`
   4. [ ] Create summary doc: `docs/specs/[spec]/task-N-summary.md`
   5. [ ] Commit changes: `./.kiro/hooks/commit-task.sh "Task N Complete: Description"` (runs release analysis automatically)
   6. [ ] **STOP** and wait for user authorization

   **Key Rules:**
   - **Implementation/Architecture tasks**: Validation MUST pass before marking complete
   - **All parent tasks**: Create BOTH completion doc AND summary doc
   - **All tasks**: STOP after completion - never auto-proceed to next task
   - **Task types are defined in tasks.md** - check the `**Type**:` field
