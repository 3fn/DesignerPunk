# Test Command Implementation

**Date**: November 19, 2025
**Purpose**: Document implementation of separated test commands for improved developer experience
**Context**: Implemented hybrid approach to separate performance tests from regular test runs

> **Historical record — command set and durations superseded.** The 2026-07-03 lane rework (commit `29bba7de`) made the default lanes timing-assertion-free and fast (~1 min warm), voiding the durations below. `npm run test:quick` was **removed 2026-08-02**: unused by CI/hooks/steering, its "ultra-fast" rationale no longer held, and its trailing `--testPathIgnorePatterns` (an array-typed jest option) made `npm run test:quick -- <file>` ADD the file as an ignore pattern instead of selecting it. Current command guidance lives in Start Up Tasks.

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

**1. Updated Start Up Tasks** (`.kiro/steering/Start Up Tasks.md`)
- Added test command selection guidelines
- Provided decision tree for AI agents
- Clarified when to use each test command

**2. Updated Spec Planning Standards** (`.kiro/steering/Spec Planning Standards.md`)
- Added test execution requirements to Tier 2 validation (npm test)
- Added test execution requirements to Tier 3 validation (npm run test:all)
- Clarified test scope for different validation tiers

**3. Updated Development Workflow** (`.kiro/steering/Development Workflow.md`)
- Added validation step with test command selection
- Integrated test commands into task completion workflow

**4. Updated package.json**
- Modified `test` script to exclude performance tests
- Added `test:all` script for comprehensive testing
- Added `test:performance` script for performance-only testing
- Added `test:quick` script for ultra-fast testing (excludes integration too)
- Updated `test:watch` and `test:coverage` to exclude performance tests

## Test Commands

### npm test (Default)
**Purpose**: Fast feedback loop for regular development
**Includes**: Unit tests, integration tests (excluding heavy performance tests)
**Excludes**: Performance stress tests, scalability tests, benchmark tests
**Duration**: ~10 minutes (64% faster than before)
**When to use**: Regular task validation, iterative development

### npm run test:all (Comprehensive)
**Purpose**: Complete validation including performance tests
**Includes**: All tests (unit, integration, performance, stress, benchmarks)
**Excludes**: Nothing
**Duration**: ~28 minutes
**When to use**: Parent task completion, before major commits, comprehensive validation

### npm run test:performance (Performance Only)
**Purpose**: Performance validation and regression testing
**Includes**: Performance tests, stress tests, scalability tests, benchmarks
**Excludes**: Regular unit and integration tests
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**When to use**: Performance optimization tasks, performance regression validation

### npm run test:quick (Ultra-Fast)
**Purpose**: Fastest possible feedback for rapid iteration
**Includes**: Unit tests only
**Excludes**: Integration tests, performance tests
**Duration**: ~5 minutes
**When to use**: Rapid iteration, TDD workflows, quick validation

## AI Agent Guidance

### Decision Tree

```
Is this a parent task completion?
├─ YES → npm run test:all (comprehensive)
└─ NO → Does task involve performance changes?
    ├─ YES → npm run test:performance
    └─ NO → npm test (default)
```

### Validation Tier Mapping

**Tier 1: Minimal Validation (Setup Tasks)**
- No test execution required (syntax validation only)

**Tier 2: Standard Validation (Implementation Tasks)**
- Use `npm test` (fast feedback)
- Excludes performance tests

**Tier 3: Comprehensive Validation (Architecture/Parent Tasks)**
- Use `npm run test:all` (complete validation)
- Includes performance tests

### Default Assumption

**Unless task explicitly specifies otherwise, use `npm test`**

This provides fast feedback while maintaining comprehensive validation for critical tasks.

## Verification Results

### Test Count Verification

```bash
# Default test command (excludes performance)
npm test -- --listTests | wc -l
# Result: 160 test files

# Comprehensive test command (includes all)
npm run test:all -- --listTests | wc -l
# Result: 166 test files

# Performance test command (performance only)
npm run test:performance -- --listTests | wc -l
# Result: 10 test files (7 performance test files)
```

### Performance Test Exclusion

Heavy performance tests excluded from default run:
- ✅ `PerformanceRegression.test.ts` (excluded)
- ✅ `PerformanceBenchmarks.test.ts` (excluded)
- ✅ `GitPerformanceOptimizer.test.ts` (excluded)
- ✅ `DocumentParsingCache.test.ts` (excluded)
- ✅ `GenerationPerformance.test.ts` (excluded)
- ✅ `OptimizationValidation.test.ts` (excluded)

Lightweight performance validation kept in default run:
- ✅ `PerformanceValidation.test.ts` (included - tests <5ms operations)

## Impact Analysis

### Before Implementation
- **Developer test run**: 28 minutes
- **Feedback loop**: Too slow for iterative development
- **Performance tests**: Always run, blocking development

### After Implementation
- **Developer test run**: 10 minutes (64% faster)
- **Feedback loop**: Acceptable for iterative development
- **Performance tests**: Available when needed, don't block development

### Developer Experience Improvement

**Time savings per test run**: 18 minutes
**Time savings per day** (assuming 5 test runs): 90 minutes (1.5 hours)
**Time savings per week** (assuming 25 test runs): 450 minutes (7.5 hours)

**This is a significant productivity improvement** ✅

## Future Enhancements

### CI/CD Integration
- Set up separate CI/CD jobs for fast tests and performance tests
- Run fast tests on all PRs
- Run performance tests on main branch or scheduled

### Performance Test Optimization
- Reduce benchmark iterations for faster execution
- Create quick smoke tests for performance validation
- Save comprehensive benchmarks for scheduled runs

### Test Organization
- Consider moving performance tests to dedicated `__performance__` directory
- Create clear separation between test types
- Improve test discoverability
