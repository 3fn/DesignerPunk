# Requirements Document: Input-Checkbox-Base & Input-Checkbox-Legal

**Date**: February 5, 2026
**Spec**: 046 - Input-Checkbox-Base
**Status**: Requirements Phase
**Dependencies**: 
- Icon-Base component (for checkmark/dash icon rendering)
- Accessibility token family (`accessibility.focus.*` tokens)
- Feedback color tokens (`color.feedback.select.*`, `color.feedback.error.*`)
- Motion tokens (`motion.selectionTransition`, `motion.buttonPress`)
- Scale tokens (`scale096`)
- Blend tokens (`blend.hoverDarker`, `blend.pressedDarker`)

---

## Introduction

The Input-Checkbox components provide binary selection controls for web, iOS, and Android platforms. This spec covers two components:

- **Input-Checkbox-Base**: General-purpose checkbox with three size variants, configurable label alignment, and support for checked, unchecked, and indeterminate states
- **Input-Checkbox-Legal**: Specialized checkbox for legal consent scenarios (terms of service, privacy policies, GDPR consent) with audit capabilities and stricter validation

Both components follow True Native Architecture with build-time platform separation, use the Icon-Base component for checkmark rendering, and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance.

**Key Architectural Principles**:
- **Stemma System**: Component architecture following [Family]-[Type]-[Variant] naming (Input-Checkbox-Base, Input-Checkbox-Legal)
- **Rosetta System**: Token architecture for new `inset.075` semantic token
- **True Native Architecture**: Separate implementations per platform (web, iOS, Android)
- **Token-based design**: All styling uses semantic tokens (no hard-coded values)
- **Icon-Base integration**: Checkmark and dash icons rendered via Icon-Base component
- **Input-Text-Base alignment**: Error and helper text patterns follow Input-Text-Base conventions
- **Test-Development-Standards**: All tests follow established testing patterns and Stemma validators

**Glossary**:
- **Checkbox**: Binary selection control (checked/unchecked)
- **Indeterminate**: Visual state indicating partial selection (neither fully checked nor unchecked)
- **Legal consent**: User acknowledgment of terms, policies, or agreements with audit requirements
- **Stemma System**: DesignerPunk's component architecture system
- **Rosetta System**: DesignerPunk's token architecture system

### Requirement 7: Platform-Specific Interactions

### Requirement 8: Web Component Implementation

**User Story**: As a web developer, I want a custom element, so that I can use the checkbox in any web framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checkbox is used on web THEN the system SHALL register as `<input-checkbox-base>` custom element
2. WHEN checkbox is rendered THEN the system SHALL use hidden native `<input type="checkbox">` for form compatibility
3. WHEN checkbox is rendered on web THEN the system SHALL use CSS logical properties for RTL support (`padding-inline`, `margin-inline-start`, etc.)
4. WHEN checkbox is rendered on iOS THEN the system SHALL use SwiftUI's native RTL handling (`leading`/`trailing` alignment)
5. WHEN checkbox is rendered on Android THEN the system SHALL use Compose's native RTL handling (`Arrangement.Start`/`End`)
6. WHEN checkbox attributes change THEN the system SHALL reactively update rendering
7. WHEN checkbox is used in a form THEN native form submission SHALL include checkbox value
8. WHEN form is reset THEN checkbox SHALL return to unchecked state (pre-checked checkboxes are not supported)
   - *Amended 2026-10-25 (Lina, owner; authority: Peter, 2026-10-25, "Fix all of them as the owners recommend; T is (A)", adopting option (a) of `.kiro/issues/2026-10-25-checkbox-reset-semantics-contract-vs-code.md` at the release 16.1.0 walk, Floor batch line 8):* AC 8 is superseded. WHEN the form is reset THEN the checkbox SHALL return to its authored state, meaning the `checked` and `indeterminate` it had when it first connected, as contract `validation_form_integration` states ("Form reset restores initial checked state"). The same applies to Input-Checkbox-Legal (Requirement 9), where a pre-check refused under `requiresExplicitConsent` is never an authored state.

---

### Requirement 9: Input-Checkbox-Legal Specific Requirements

**User Story**: As a product owner, I want a specialized legal checkbox, so that I can collect legally compliant consent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Input-Checkbox-Legal is rendered THEN the system SHALL use fixed sizing: lg box (40px) with `labelSm` typography
2. WHEN Input-Checkbox-Legal is rendered THEN the system SHALL use top label alignment (not configurable)
3. WHEN `requiresExplicitConsent` is true THEN the system SHALL prevent pre-checking the checkbox
4. WHEN `requiresExplicitConsent` is true AND `checked={true}` is passed THEN the system SHALL override to `checked={false}` and emit console warning
5. WHEN checkbox state changes THEN the system SHALL call `onConsentChange` with boolean and ISO 8601 timestamp string
6. WHEN `legalTextId` is provided THEN the system SHALL include it in consent callback for audit trail
7. WHEN `legalTextVersion` is provided THEN the system SHALL include it in consent callback for audit trail
8. WHEN `showRequiredIndicator` is true THEN the system SHALL display required indicator
9. IF `showRequiredIndicator` is not provided THEN the system SHALL default to true
10. WHEN Input-Checkbox-Legal is rendered THEN the system SHALL NOT support indeterminate state
11. WHEN Input-Checkbox-Legal is rendered THEN label text SHALL NOT be truncated

---

### Requirement 10: New Token Creation (Rosetta System)

**User Story**: As a design system maintainer, I want the inset.075 token created following Rosetta architecture, so that checkbox sizing follows mathematical consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing checkbox THEN the system SHALL create `inset.075` semantic token in `src/tokens/semantic/SpacingTokens.ts`
2. WHEN creating `inset.075` THEN the token SHALL reference `space075` primitive token
3. WHEN creating `inset.075` THEN the token SHALL follow mathematical relationship: 0.75 × base (8px) = 6px
4. WHEN creating `inset.075` THEN the token SHALL include JSDoc documentation following existing inset token patterns
5. WHEN `inset.075` is created THEN platform-specific token generation SHALL automatically include the new token
6. WHEN `inset.075` is created THEN Chip-Base component MAY be updated to reference it (optional refactor)
